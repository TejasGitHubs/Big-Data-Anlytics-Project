# Housing_Loan_Prediction_Project
The CCAO property tax valuation process proposed by the former Cook County Assessor is neither accurate  nor fair. As a result, people living in poorer areas tend to pay more taxes as a percentage of the value of their  homes than residents in richer communities. The lack of uniformity of the system and defective models are  the biggest problems. Our responsibility is to appraise the value of Cook county’s property as close as possible to its actual value in  fair, accurate and transparent approaches and see what the future could look like based on historic record.
Project involved variable selection and building a machine learning model from scratch that predicts the house prices as close to the original prices based on features like Number of rooms, area etc. • Using Linear regression, lasso regression and random forest methods, built a machine learning model to predicted house prices. Applied correlation to identify highly correlated variables so that they can be removed. • Stood 6th amongst 62 pairs in terms of having less RMSE and high Accuracy of 83%. R Programming, AWS
